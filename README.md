# WeddingBlog

This is the repository for our Disney Wedding Blog. The blog will be used to update our guests on any information surrounding our wedding.

The posts will be served from a MariaDB databse to the browser using PHP. The public facing side of the blog will allow our guests to read the updates as well as post comments and questions to each post.

The administrative front end will allow authorized users to add or edit posts to the blog.

During development the blog is hosted on a local machine. Once ready for an initial release, I will publish the blog to either a new domain or a subdomain of my website (www.clinetechnologysolutions.com)
